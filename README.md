# folder-as-album
Have you ever suffered because your player couldn't play mp3 files by folder? With this little utility, you can easily change the album tag to the name of the folder where it lies. It works recursively so you need to run it once and set your desired folder and it will work even for subfolders.

#Instalation
```
go install github.com/biganashvili/folder-as-album
```
#Usage
```
folder-as-album --dir="2pac discography"
```
